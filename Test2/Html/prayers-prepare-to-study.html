<p class="header">Prayer for Preparation to Study</p>

<p>Lord, I know you are with me and love me.<br />
Give me peace of mind as I prepare for this time of study.<br />
Help me to focus on my books and notes,<br />
keep me from all distractions so that I will make the best use<br />
of this time that is available to me.<br /><br />
Give me insight that I might understand what I am studying,<br />
and help me to remember it when the time comes.<br />
Above all, I thank you for the ability to be able to study<br />
and for the many gifts and talents you have given me.<br />
Help me always to use them in such a way<br />
that they honour you and do justice to myself.  Amen</p>
