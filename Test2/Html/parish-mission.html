Every institution &#8211; individual, family, community and even corporate &#8211; needs a vision! Vision gives perspective, unites efforts and lends purpose to our activities. In working for the achievement of the vision, different values are discovered: cooperation, understanding, tolerance and love. A vision also enables us to look into our lives anew and herald new beginnings.<br /><br />As members of one Church &#8211; global as well as parish &#8211; Jesus is our Vision! We look to him and at him for guidance and support. And inspired by his life, we constantly evolve new visions of fulfilling his purpose in our times, of building God&#8217;s kingdom of love, freedom, justice and peace.<br /><br />In the light of all this, our Parish has evolved a Vision Statement that encompasses different levels in the parish. Looking at the key aspects of our Parish vision statement, we focus on:<br /><br /><b>CHRIST CENTERED FAMILIES:</b> Our homes must be centres of love, trust and service. Each one of us must be sensitive, loving and accepting of each member of the family. Thus our families will witness to Gospel values and reflect Christian living.<br /><br /><b>PARTICIPATIVE COMMUNITY:</b> We live in a multi-cultural, multi-religious society. We must therefore respect each other&#8217;s faith, build healthy relationships with all around and respond to local social, political or environmental issues. Through active involvement, like leaven in the dough, our SCCs will build neighbourhood community spirit with all people.<br /><br /><b>REACHING OUT TO THE POOR AND MARGINALISED:</b> There are so many around us who are broken &#8211; emotionally, economically, physically and spiritually. Let us reach out in concern to all in need: not only the economically needy but also those who suffer due to loneliness, addictions, desertion, depression, etc.<br /><br />In these ways we could strengthen and transform our families, neighbourhood and parish to make our vision come alive.<br />
