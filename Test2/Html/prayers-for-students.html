<p class="header">Prayer for Students</p>

<p>Lord, pour out your Spirit of Wisdom on these students:<br />
help them to remain calm,<br />
to attend carefully to the questions asked,<br />
to think clearly, to remember accurately,<br />
and to express themselves well.<br /><br />
Grant that they may reflect on the best of the work they have done<br />
and the best of the teaching they have received.<br />
Accept their best efforts in these examinations<br />
and in the great test of life on earth.<br />
May your love be upon them, O Lord,<br />
as they place all their trust in you.<br />
We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
