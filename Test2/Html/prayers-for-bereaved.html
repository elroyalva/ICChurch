<p class="header">Prayer for the Bereaved</p>

<p>God, loving Father, be close to those who are mourning the loss of one so dear to them. Heal the pain they now suffer, lighten their darkness and scatter the doubts that their grief brings. May they feel Christ’s healing power in their pain and distress. Give them the strength to keep on going forward with faith as their consolation and eternal life as their hope. Grant everlasting rest and peace to the one they loved. May they keep the memory of their joy in him/her ever fresh. Grant that we may all be gathered together in the joy of your Kingdom. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
