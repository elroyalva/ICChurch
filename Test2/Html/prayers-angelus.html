<p>
V: The Angel of the Lord declared to Mary<br />
R: And she conceived of the Holy Spirit.<br />
(Hail Mary...)
<br /><br />
V: Behold the handmaid of the Lord.<br />
R: Be it done unto me according to Thy word.<br />
(Hail Mary...)
<br /><br />
V: And the Word was made Flesh.<br />
R: And dwelt among us.<br />
(Hail Mary...)
<br /><br />
V: Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God.<br />
R: that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. 
<br /><br />
<strong>Let us pray:</strong><br />
Pour forth, we beseech Thee, O Lord, Thy grace into our hearts; that we, to whom the incarnation of Christ, Thy Son, was made known by the message of an angel, may by His Passion and Cross be brought to the glory of His Resurrection, through the same Christ Our Lord. Amen. 
<br /><br />
<strong>Regina Coeli</strong><br />
(This prayer replaces the Angelus in the season of Easter i.e from Easter Sunday till the Pentecost Sunday)<br /><br />
V: Queen of Heaven, rejoice! Alleluia.<br /><br />
V: For He whom you did merit to bear. Alleluia.<br /><br />
V: Has risen, as He said. Alleluia.<br /><br />
V: Pray for us to God. Alleluia.<br /><br />
V: Rejoice and be glad, O Virgin Mary. Alleluia.<br /><br />
V: For the Lord has risen indeed. Alleluia.<br /><br />

<strong>Let us pray:</strong><br />
O God, who gave joy to the world through the resurrection of Thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, grant we beseech Thee, that through the intercession of the Virgin Mary, His Mother, we may obtain the joys of everlasting life. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.
