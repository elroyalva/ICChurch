<p class="header">Prayer for the Caregivers</p>

<p>Pour out your blessings, Lord, upon your faithful servants. Grant them patience and courage in their daily tasks. Fill them with the gift of love to strengthen them in the work to which you have called them. Give them an understanding of your caring presence, so that at all times they may confidently place their trust in you. Forgive them their failures and weakness so that they may experience your gift of peace in their lives. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
