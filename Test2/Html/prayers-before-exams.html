<p class="header">Prayer before an Examination</p>

<p>Dear Lord, as I take this exam, I thank you that my value<br />
Is not based on my performance, but on your great love for me.<br />
Come into my heart so that we can walk through this time together.<br />
Help me, not only with this test, but the many tests of life that are sure to come my way.<br /><br />
As I take this exam, bring back to my mind everything I studied<br />
and be gracious with what I have overlooked.<br />
Help me to remain focussed and clam, confident in the facts and in my ability,<br />
and firm in the knowledge that no matter what happens today you are there with me.  Amen</p>
