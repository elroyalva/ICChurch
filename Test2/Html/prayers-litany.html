<strong>General:</strong><br />
Let us pray-  Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord God, that we Thy servants may enjoy perpetual health of mind and body, and by the glorious intercession of the Blessed Mary, ever Virgin, be delivered from present sorrow and enjoy everlasting happiness. Through Christ Our Lord. Amen.<br /><br />

<strong>During Advent:</strong><br />
Let us pray - O God, you willed that, at the message of an angel, your word should take flesh  in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary; grant to your suppliant people, that we, who believe her to be truly the Mother of God, may be helped by her intercession with you. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.<br /><br />

<strong>From Christmas to the Purification:</strong><br />
Let us pray - O God, by the fruitful virginity of Blessed Mary, you bestowed upon the human race  the rewards of eternal salvation;  grant, we beg you,
that we may feel the power of her intercession, through whom we have been made worthy  to receive the Author of life, our Lord Jesus Christ your Son, who lives and reigns with you forever and ever. Amen.<br /><br />

<strong>During Paschaltime:</strong><br />
Let us pray -  O God, who by the Resurrection of your Son,  our Lord Jesus Christ, granted joy to the whole world, grant, we beg you, that through the intercession of the Virgin Mary, his Mother, we may attain the joys of eternal life. Through the same Christ our Lord.  Amen.</p>
