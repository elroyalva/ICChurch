<p>Dear Lady of Perpetual Help, spotless Mother of God, we choose thee as the Mistress and Lady of this House. Guard it Dearest Mother, from pestilence, lightning, fire and tempest, from schisms and heresies, from air raids and the malice of enemies. Protect those who dwell herein most Loving Mother, watch over their going out and their coming in, and preserve them from sudden death. Keep us away from all sin and harm, and pray for us, that we may serve God faithfully here, and afterwards, enjoy with thee for evermore, the blissful vision of His face. Amen.</p>
